# Comment Formats

As I merged code I found things I thought worth keeping track of.
I have added comments throughout repo with the following formats:

`// fetch-performance:` This relates to possible over fetching and feature based performance issues.

`// mono-repo:` Anything I have changed along the way, and want to be able to reference as we merge in next client.
